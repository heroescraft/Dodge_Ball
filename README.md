# Dodge Ball!

Simple pygame random ball falling game. Every ten times the ball hits the ground, the game speeds up.

(So it gets exponentially faster...)

Note: You must have [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news "pygame") for this game to work.

## Controls:

Arrow keys to move side to side.

No jumping yet. (Might add it.)

Space when game over.

F3 when debugging.

## Misc:

Fonts downloaded from <https://fonts.google.com> (Press_Start_2P and Roboto)

Textures created by me.

Photo transparency by <https://www3.lunapic.com/editor/?action=transparent>
